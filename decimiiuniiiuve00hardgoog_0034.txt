the date at which he was promoted to the praefectura
ond sent to Britain. We have, however, a lemniaco onte
qoem in the fact that, as we know from Martial, he had

settled at Rome at any rate by 91 mn, and probably
for a few years earlier, while between the close of his
military career and his settlcment at Rome his municipal
career at Aquinum, which must have occupied four or ’
five years, has to be placed, Supposing, therefore, that
he settled in Rome in 88 or 89, his military career may
have closed in 83 or 84. A further clue is perhaps
' offered by tbe Licea, which say, “fecit eum praefectum
cohortis contra Scotos qui bellum contra Romanos
moverant.'' N ow the only war with the Scotch which we
know of at this period was that under 'Agricola who
was in Britain from 78 to 84, and who first advanced
into Scotland in 81 (Tac. Acrae. 23). We may then
with some probability suppose that Juvenal was pro-
moted to the second stage in the equestres militia in 81
nu, and that he returned horne with Agricola in 84.
Various references to Britain, some of them almost too
definite to be mere literary reminiscences, are found

scattered about in the Satires. Thus in ii. 159-161 he ¹

mentions the ancient name of Ireland, Iuverna, which is
not known to Tacitus in the Agricola, and speaks of the
recent conquest of the Orcades (cf. Tac. Apris. 10)
and the short British night, in iv. 127 he mentions
the British war-chariots, and in 141 the oysters of
Rutupiae 3 in x. 14 the British whales 5 in xiv. 196
the British tribe of the Brigantes 3 in xv. lll he refers

explained in this wey, as we know from Pliny (N. H. xxix. 6) that
explorera were sent out by Nero to Ethiopia, who brought baclr a
repert οἰ their observatione.
