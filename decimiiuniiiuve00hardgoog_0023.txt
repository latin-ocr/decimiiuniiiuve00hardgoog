INTRODUOTION xix

fact worth noting that Decimus, J uvenal¹s praenomen, is
common in the plebeian Gens of 5115 J unii (see Liv. viii.
12, x. 43, xxxiv. 45 3 Epir. 56, etc), and it would be

statement from some ancient source which has since
been lost In the first place, it is difficult to account for
so precise a statement on any other supposition; and, in
the next place, it will be found to agree with all the
dates furnished by the Satires themselves, and through

.. these with the almost unanimous statement of the Lines

that he did not pubhsh any Satires till middle age (“ ad
mediam fere aetatem declamavit '’). The Satires them-
