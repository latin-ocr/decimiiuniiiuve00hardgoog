1. ratio studiorum, “motivo of our studies.'' dudda is evi·
dently used (both here and in line 17) of poetry, as the context

proves.

' ln Caesare tantum. See Introduction, where the dateof
Juvenal’s Satires is discussed. Praetically we have to choose
here between Trajan and Hadrian. Pliny says of Trajan, Paney.
47, “sub te spiritum et san inem et patriam receerunt
studia '’; sec also Ep, iii. 18 ; iiii the studia are shown by the
context to be orato and philosoph , and Hadrian was the first

’ em ror since Clau ins who show interest in poc ;hewas

in eed a poet himself. Friedliinder believes that ines 1·21
were added as a complimentary dedication to Hadrian, while
the rest of the Satire was written earlier. He points out the
entire want of connection between this preface, which speaks of
encouragement given to poetry, and all that follows, dealing as
it does with the hardships and poverty of historiens, lawyers,
rhetoricians, etc. There is certainly some want of art in the
Satire, unless wc suppose that this view is correct. Hadrian
succeeded Trajan in 117 Ab.

3. respexit, has taken notice of. Cous. Verg. Eri. i. 28,
“ Libertas, quae sera tamen respexit inertem.”

4. balneolum. In Rome and the large towns there were

public baths where very often no charge was made to the bathers,
ut even here the number of bathers was so lar ethat it was
found a profitable occupatiori to start private bathe (bolma
meritoria), at which a small charge, usually a paredrum, was
made. Sen. Ep. 86, “balneum res quadrantaria.‘’ sar. vi.
447, “quadrante lavari.'‘ At Gabii, a primitive little place-

conf. Sat. iii. 192-there would be no pu lic bath, anda private
pnle1yppld probably be but a poor speculaticn. Conf. Hor. Ep

furnos, bakehouses.
