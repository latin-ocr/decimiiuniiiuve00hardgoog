lx INTRODUGTION

land. of this (lodex five fragments alone romain, dis-
covered, when the municipal archives of Aarau were being
overhauled, to be doing duty as bindings for some of the
documents. These fragments contain a few lines of Sat.
ii, 239 lines of Sat. vi.‚ and porticus of Sat. iii. and
vii. (iii. 6-13, 35-63, 64-923 vii. 57-85, 86-114, 115-
143, 144-172), together with the Scholia belonging to
them. The MS. dates from the tenth or eleveuth century,
and shows in its readings the closest relationship to P.
Like P, too, it had been corrected in a second hand from
one of the interpolated MSS. The (lodex itself was
probably destroyed at the Reformation. The fragments
are generally known as the Scbedoe Ascatancas, and are
symbolised iu the apparatas criticas as A. They agree
with P. in establishing the following new readings :—“ In

summa,” iii. 7 9 3 “Lacemae,’'vii 1143 “ponere,''vu149;

“forte'' vii. 156. See Wirz in Hermes, vol. xv. carsoli,
aud Beer, Spicc'leyiam, pp. 28-33.

. In addition to the MSS. of the text of Juvenal it
remains to notice that the Scholia attached to the MSS. of
this better class are often important for critical purposes,
either directly quoting the readings of the text in lemmata,
or suggesting it by their interpretations. These Scholia
are of an essentially different character from those in the
interpolated MSS. They are much briefen but far more
valuable‚ and many of them may probably date back as
far as the end of the fourth century. At that period,
as we know from Ammianus Marcellinus (28, 4, 14),
Juvenal was much aud carefully read These Scholia
are found almost identical in P. and in the Cod.
Scapolleosis 870, into which, as we have seen, they
were undoubtedly copied from the lost Codex, D. 304.
