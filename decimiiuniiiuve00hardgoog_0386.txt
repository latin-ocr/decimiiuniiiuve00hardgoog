SATIRE XV

On the authenticity of this Satire, see Introd. p. liii.

1. qualia demens Aegyptus portenta colat. Conf. Cic.
deth. Deor. iii. 39, “omne fere genus bestiarum consecranmt
Aegyptii.'’ Ocni. also Tusa. v. 78, “Aegyptiorum morem quis

ignorati quorum imbutae mentes pravitatis erroribus quamvis .
carnrficmam prius subrermt quam rbrm aut asprdem aut faelem '

aut canem aut crocodilon violent.''

2. Crocodilon adorat. Conf. Herod. ii. 69. The people

round Thebes worshipped it; but those round Elephantine
killed and ate it.

3. saturam serpentibus lbln. Cous. Cic. dc Not. Deor. i.
39, “ibes maximam vim serpentium conficiunt.” Herodotus,

ii. 75, says that the ibis devoured the winged serpente which ἶ

came from Arabia.
4. cercopitheci, long-tailedape. Conf. Mart. xiv. 202. 3
5. magicae. . . chordae. Outside the ruins of Thebes ,

there was (and still is) a colossal statue of Memnon, the Graecised ,

form of Amenophis, the name of several Egyptian kings. To

this king were ascribed hythe Alexandrian writers the attri- κ

butes as well as the name of Memnon, the son of Aurora and
Tithonus, who was killed by Achilles before lhoy. The statue
was always believed to give forth one musical note at the dawn

of each day, and Strabo, the geographer, declares that he heard ⁴

it. Whether this was a trick of the priests to bring ¹out the
connection between Memnon and Aurora, or whether any
scientific reason can be found for the phenomenon in the heat
of the sun acting upon the chillcd air in the creviccs of the
stone, has been much disputed. (lons. Tac. Aren. ii. 61, “Mem-
nonis saxea effigies . . . vocalem sonum reddens ”3 and Strab.
xvii. 1, 46.

dimidio. In Juvenal's time the statue was nrutilated; it
was afterwards restored by Septimius Severus. Cous. Sat. viii.
4, “dimidios Ourios.”

6. centum. . . porus. Oonf. Hom. Il. ix. 381.

obruta. It had long since been in ruins, probably ever since
the inpasion of Cambyses. Strabo says of it, νυνὶ δὲ κωμηδὸν
συνΟίΚΕίΤαί.

7. aeluros. Most MSS. have coeruleos, P. has aculeos,

ppt ἔῑᾳζοεθὲαἰλούρους) is an almost certain emendation. Conf.
er .n. .

piscem fluminis. Herodotus, ii. 72, mentions the eel.
