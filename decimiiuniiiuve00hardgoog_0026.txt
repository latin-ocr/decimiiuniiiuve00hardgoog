xxii INTRODUOTION

probability that Book ΠΙ. would be later than Book 11,
preclude us from assigning it to the beginning of Trajan's
reign, I think we must fix its date soon after Hadrian's
accession, and no doubt before his departure from Rome
on his first progress, te. between 118 and 121 an.

Book IV, containing Sat. unii, precenta no chrono
logical data except that in xi. 203 he speaks of himself
as an old man, hut, as all the other Books do, wc may
fairly place its date somewhere between that of Book
III. and Book V.

Book V. (Sat xiii-xvi.) contains two references to the
year 127 nra—(l) in xiii. 18, where Juvenal speaks of
his friend Calvinus as sixty- years old, and born Fonteio
conada, the Fonteius in question being almost certainly
Fonteius Capito, who was consul in 67 an. (000 0010
cd loe.) ; (2) Sat. xv. 27 mentions the quarrel between the
Tentyrites and Ombites as happening “nuper consule
Iunco,’' is. in 127 nn. when an Aemilius Juncus was

consul Accordingly, if we allow for the word nemer ¹

espace of from three 10 eight years, the Setire would
have been written between 130 and 135 an. Further

than this we may notice that in Sat. i 25 Juvenal l

speaks of his own youth as a time long past, that in
80101209 he is an old man who likes to bask in the
sun; that the whole toue 01 his address to Calvinus in
the beginning of Sat xiii. is that 01 an older man to a
younger, and Calvinus 00 we have seen was¹ sixty ; and
lastly‚ that there are distinet traces 01 senility in some of
the later Satires, as compared with the earlier ones, and
especially in the two last 3-frcm the internal evidence
01 the Satires themselves, therefore, we should assume
that Juvenal began to write when he was by no means 0
