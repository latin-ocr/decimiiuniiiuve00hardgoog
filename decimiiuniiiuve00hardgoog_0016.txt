xii INTRODUOTION

perhaps been the fashion with most editors unduly to
depreciate. Of these no fcwer than thirteen distinct
versions are found in the numerous MSS. of the Satires.
As a rule each Ms. has only one of these, but in some
levasses, and especially in the later MSS, several of them
are inserted, one after the other, either in the same or in
different hands. Although no two of these Lines aro
exactly tho same, it is possible to reduce the thirteen
to five groups, the different members of each being closely

. akin to one another, and differing more or less widely

from the other groups.1 As thero is no English edition
of Juvenal which contains these Licea, and as the valae
of any inferonces drawn from them can be better tested
by actual comparison of the various statements in their
context, Ι do not think it wasto of space to give in full
atype of each group. In order as far as possible to give
an idea of the variation within the groups themselves, Ι
insert the chief variatious from what secrns to be the
original version of each group in brackets. As the Lc‘ves
have hitherto been best known from Jahn's edition of
1851, who, however, only gives seven of them,I have

arranged the groups in such a way that J ahn's order may =

Grion? Ι. consiste of two Lines (Jahn i. aud ii), '

differing very slightly from one another, though tho
second is a somewhat amplified version. The first of
these, being given in Valla’s edition, and therefore pre
sumably from Valla's lost MS. (see below, p. lviii), and
also in P, though in a later hand than the Scholia, as
well asina London MS. of tho ninth century (Coc.
Brit. Mos. add. 15,600)‚ is probably the oldest of the
