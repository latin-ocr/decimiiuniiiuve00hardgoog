the scholiast is often not able to identify, while of those
who are known several may have been taken from the
earlier Satires. We here find very few descriptione of
Roman life. In great part the Satires might have been
written by one who hod never seen Rome, though there
are one or two exceptione to this, such as the description
of the pompa Circcnec'o in x. 35, etc. 3 of the harbour at
Ostia iu xii. 75„ etc.; tho reference to some theft from
the temple of Mars Ultor in xiv. 261. Such descriptione
as those of tho fall of Sejanus (x. 66, etc), the marriage
of Messalina (x. 330), and others, might have been, and no
doubt were, taken from literature. Another point of
distinction is that while in the earlier Satires J uvcnal
professcd to discard mythological subjecte in order to deal
with actual life (i 55 foll), and for the most part does
sc, in the later Satires, on the other hand, references to
mythology are comparatively frequent, ap. the Index
will show that mentionis made of Nestor, Peleus, Ajax‚
Ulysscs, Priam, Alcinous, Antiphates, Oirce, Iphigenia,
Orestes, Hippolytus, the golden fieeoe, Menoeceus, Prome·
theos, etc. Again, while the Roman characters in the
first class are with a few exceptions, such as Tigellinus,
etc, taken from Domitian's reign, those in the second class
often come from republican days, while characters from
Greek history are often introduced. Thus we have
Pompeius, Caesar, Antonius, Cicero, (lat0, Catilina, (lethe—
gus, Marius, Mithridates, Pyrrhus, Lucretia, the Decii 3 .
and from Greek history, Xerxes, Alexander, Demosthenes,
Oroesus, Solon, etc¹ In fact, rhetorical theses, which in
the earlier Satires are mentioned only to be laughed at,
are in the later ones not uncommonly worked in and
doretailed into the general structure of the Satire.
