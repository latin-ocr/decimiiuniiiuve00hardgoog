To this it may be added that the earlier Satires,
though not strictly speaking declamations, are still set
pieces, dealing each with some one subject, the illustra-
tions being marshalled in regular order, and are inthis
respect a strong contrast to the less elaborate and more
loosely construeted Satires of Horace, where each Satine
deals with everything. Another consequence 01 J uvenal’s
rhetorical treatment 01 his subject, viz. the desire 101
striking collocation or piquant antiolimax, is also shown
in both classes 01 Satires, resulting in the non-moral
point 01 view which sometimes reveals itself, as when the
rich barber excites as much indignation as the abandoned
eriminal, the horsey noble as the 01001 provincial governor,
the luxury 01 Crispinus as his incest and adultery, the
Troica of Nero as his mother’s murder.

But while there is a distinction between the styles 01
Books Ι.-ΙΙ., and Book ΙΙΙ., there is no less difference,
though 01 another sort, between x, xii-xiv, and the
two last Satires. The former, the declamatory Satires
