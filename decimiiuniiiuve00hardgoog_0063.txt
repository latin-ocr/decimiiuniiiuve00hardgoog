INTRODUGTION lix

from Persius, and again 455-458 from Juvenal, while of
the first 190 verses 48 arc from Juvenal and 5 from
Persius. In other words, 320 verses out of 458 are
from Juvenal and Persius. Following the Florilegium

are Scholia to Juvenal, and these are almost identical
with those in P. Now when we bear in mind the
large majority of excerpts from Juvenal and Persius in
the Florilegium, and the presence of the Scholia to
Juvenal, and put this together with the fact that thc
same monastery undoubtedly once possessed a Oodcx of
Juvenal and Persius, the conclusion is practically certain
that the monh who put together the Florilegium and
wrote the Scholia had before him the (lodex of Juvenal,
which is now lost That this (lodex was closely ahin to
P. is apparent both from the similarity of readings in
the text, and also from the very close resemblance of the
Scholia which, as will be seen below, differ essentially
in the two classes of Mes,- but still the evidence shows
that neither was the Codes Sangallearc's copied from P.
nor P. from it. By far the most important reading
which we gain from the Florilegium is “sufflamine mulio
consul ’² in viii. 148, which will in future take the place
of theold “multo sufflamine‚’' but “ robum '' in viii. 155,
“matellae'' in x. 64, “quem'' in vii. 214, “nepotes” in
viii. 67, and “fulva'' in xii. 102, are all found in the Flori-
legium (F.) either alone or in conjunction with P. It is
probably amere accident that no lineis quoted in the
Florilegium from Sat. xvi. For a full account of this
MS. see 0. Stephan in the Rheinisches Museum, vol. xl.
pp. 263-282.

to the library of the parochial church at Aaron in Switzer-
