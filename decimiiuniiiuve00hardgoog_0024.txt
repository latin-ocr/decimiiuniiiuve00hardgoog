xx INTRODUCTION

selves are divided according to the earliest MSS. into
five books, and there is internal evidence for supposing
both that this division dates from Juvenal's own time,
and also that, like tho Lecta-s of Pliny, the Epiyrcms of
Martini, aad probably the H istoriae of Tacitus, the books
were published separately and in their present order.

Book Ι. contains Sat. i.-v. That this was published
after Domitian's death is proved by the last lines os
Sat. iv.; that it was published after 100 an. is proved
by the reference to Marius Priscus in Sat. i. 49, who
was condemned in the beginning of that year (Plin. Ep.
ii. 11); that it was published after 105 an, the probable
date of the death of Aquilius Regulus, may with prob
ability be inferred if Regulus is the arch-informer men-
tioned in Sat. i. 33-56 31 that it was not published much
later than this is shown by the fact that the condemna-
tion of Marius was still comparatively recent when Sat.
viii. was published (see line 120). ⁴

Book II. contains Sat. vi, and was probably publishcd

shortly after 115 an, an inference drawn from lines
loe-411-

instantem regi Armenio Parthoque cometen
prima videt, famam rumoresque illa recentis
excipit ad portas, quosdam facit: isse Niphatem
in populos magnoque illiecuneta arva teneri
diluvio, nutare urbes, subsidere terras, etc.-

whieh contain a clear reference to the Parthian expedition
of Trajan which commeneed in 112 A.n.; to the comet

² That this is so is, Ι think, rendered very probable by the way
in which Pliny speaks of Regulus, “omnium bipedum nequissi-
mus.'' “Ouncti detestantur, odernam: curatur amultis, timetur
apluribus,” ete, Ep. i. 5, 14-15.
