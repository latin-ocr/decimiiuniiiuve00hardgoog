The first Satine is a sort of general indictment of the .
times: vice is at its zenith 3 there never wasa greater
'abundance of it3 it is difficult not to write satires3
indignation compels at any rate the attempt, Let us
see what in this general introduction strikes him most.
First of all there is the frequency and length of recitatione,
