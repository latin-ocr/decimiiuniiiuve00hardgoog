INTRODUCTION lxi

Gorresponding Scholia are also found in the fragments oi
Aaron As an instance ol the way in which the lemmata
prove a reading we may‘take viii. 155, to which there is
a scholion, “ robumque, ic. robustum: mium: unde
Hercules robus dictus est '' 3 while an example of a
reading being suggested by the interpretationes the
scholiast is furnished in the same Satine, line 157, where
the scholion on the word Eponam is “quia mulio est
qui consul fertur3 Epona dea mulionum est'' Other
examples might easily be collected from the apparatus
enthea. The Scholia which Valla published in his
edition, though somewhat hiller, have a general resem-
blance to those iu P. Valla himself attributes them to
Probus, not of course the Valerius Probus of Berytus,
since he flonrished in N ero’s reign It doesnot, however,
seem possible to fix their authorship. Valla’s Scholia
only go aa sar as Set. vin 197. In the apparatas
atticas readings iu any way suggested or confirmed by
the Scholia, whether in P. or the Codex Sangalleaaia, are
symbolised by S. It only remeius to notice two interest
ing fragments ofa palimpsest MS. belonging to the
interpolated class, but probably going back as far as the
fifth or sixth century3 these are the socalled Fragmenta
Bobicnsc'o (from the Irish monastery of Bobio in N. Italy),
now in the Vatican‚ written in uncials, and containing
only Sat. xiv. 323—, xv. 43.
