xxxii INTRODUCTION

Juvenal, according to the same evidence, held at his

native town Aquinum, imply the tenure of other offices ‘l

preparatory to this. The duoviri were the highest
magistrates in the municipia and coloniae of Italy and
the western provinces, those of every fifth year, viz.
that iu which the local census was taken, being called
daoairi quinquennales. There is some reason to suppose
that one of these fifth years would have fallen in Aquinum
in 87 n.n.,1 and this year accordinglywe mayhypothetically
assign as J uvenal's year of office. Prior to that he must
have held the offices of quaestor and aedile, each post being
held fora year, no interval being required between the
several offices as at Rome, though the quaestorship could
nothe held before the age of twenty-five. The country
towns of Italy were, as we knoW, already becoming
depopulated, and there was probably very little com-
petition for these offices, and as inscriptions prove, they
were held over and over again by the same persons, so
that there is no reason why Juvenal should not have
been quaestor in 85, the year after his return from
Britain, aedile in 86, and duovir quinquennalis in 87.2
Very likely in the latter year he may have been elected
by his fellow-townsmen flamen diui Vespasiani, an
office, or rather an honour, which iu some towns was
annual, in others permanent 3 in Aquinum it seems to

have been the latter (Wilmanns‚ 2046).³ After this

¹ nnis is based on an inference from Wilmanns, 2046, in which
27 an. seems to ba a year in which drwoiri quinquennales were
appointed at Aquinum.

² A military career similar to J uvenal's, followed by municipal
magistrecies, finds examplea in Wilmanns, 694, 1266, 1815, 2168.
