Ono 011110 most favourite amusements 01 the Roman pooplo, both
before and after the foundation 01 the Empire, was the ohariot
race in tho Circus Maximus. Thasos eotocles, like the gladia·

1 ¹ torial shows and tho cenationes 01 1110 amphitheatro, were de-

frayed either by the magistrates 01 by private individuale, and
tho eost must have boen immense. As, however, those indi·
viduals could hardly themselves provide all the barses, chariots,
and other apparatus necessary, there grew up companies 01
capitalists, mostl 1101111111 Equestrian order, who kept 111
immenso plant 01 111 these thin , which they then supplied
on contract to those who rovide the entertainmont. As four
chariots usually compoted 111 1 rece, four companies existed,
oach 01 which assumed a particular colour, green, red, white,
ond blue, and were hence called “factiones'’ Tho existence 01
those companies immensoly increasod tho exoitemont 01 the
poople, who to a man were partisans 01 one or other 01 the
actions, and the interest lay not in which horsos or charioteers
won, but 10 which 11011011 they belonged. As Pliny says (Ep.
ix. 6), “favent panno, pannum amant. . . et si hic color illuc,
illo huo transforatur . . . agitatores illos, equos illos . . . quorum
clamitant nomino, relinquent.” The wild excitemont 01 the
hugo crowd defies description ; thoy had few political interests,
an tho emperors wora astute enough to encourage the interest
in tho circus, which might have otherwise found a moro danger·
