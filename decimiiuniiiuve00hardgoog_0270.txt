was executed in 83 mn. on account os a suspected intr-igue with
Domitia, Dio Ceae. 67, 3. Martial, xi. 13, has an epitaph on
him, which ends “ atque omnes Veneres Cupidinestyue hoc sunt
condita, quo Paris, sepulchro.” It was the usua custom in
theatrical circles for the same names to be handed down among
the leading actore. Thus this Paris only assumed the name of
the famous pantomimist ol that name under Nero, and after him
three others followed, bearing the same name. Roman traged
never won its way into the favour of the people, and, as Frie -
ltinder describes it, tended to be resolved into its clemente. One
of these elements was dancing and gesticulation, either accom-
panicd or not with words. Out of this grew, under the reign
ol Augustus, -the pantomime. The sanccts were chosen gener-
ally from tragedy, but sometimes also from comedy, and the
pantomime represented the various characters as well as the
plot by his dancin end gestures, while the libretto os the piece
was usually sung iry a chorus The subjecte were sometimes
historioal, but more often mythologiea13 ep. Turnus, Dido,
Hector, Niobe, Philomela, etc. The skill with which the
characters, whether male or female, were represented was extra·
ordinary. The librettos‚ fabulae saltiaco, were usually quite
subordinate to the dancing‚ and of no literary velue, but we
heer occasionally of good poete writing them. Lucan wrote
fourteen, and Statius is here described as starving for all his
Tlucee'e can do for him, but getting a good price by sellin his
nnpublished pantomime, the Agave, to Paris, who would anca
it.

88. Ille et militiae, etc. The Scholicst aud the Lives say
that these lines were tha cause of Juvenal’s banishment. On
the subject of the banishment, see Introduction. If it took place
under Hadrian, as is probahle, these lines, published under

Trajan, ma very likely have been repeated in the circus by the
crowd in allusion to some unpopnlar favourite of Hadrian, and
so have ceused Juvenal’s exile.

89. semenstri. . . auro, “the ring won by six months'
service.” Young men about to enter on the senatorial career
were obliged to eerv'e first as military tribunes in a legion.
After Claudius‚·however (Suet. Claud. 25), this became in many
cases a mere formality, and six months' service, osten only
nominal (as in Pliny's case, who was a tribune os the logio iii.
Gallico, employed in clerica] work), became a sufficient qualifica-
tiou, and epse forto conferred equestrian rank ; hence the tenu
“semenstre aurum ” with reference to the knight’s ring.
Similarly we find in inscriptions “tribunus semenstris,’' erere
3442; and Pliny, Ep. iv. 4, 2, uses the phrase “tribunatu
semenstri.” Those tribuat militam who were passing through
the senatorial careres bonorum wera tribeati loticiam& those
