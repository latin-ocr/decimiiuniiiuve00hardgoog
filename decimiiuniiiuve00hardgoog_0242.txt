162 NOTES 111.

conr Hor. 01111. 14, 15-ro‚ “Frustra per autumnos nocentem
corporibus metuemus austrum. ”

60. utque lacus suberant, “and when the lakes were
below them,’' ic. the Lacus Albani, about fourteen miles from
Rome. Domitian hed a villa at Alba Longa, where he spent
much of his time. See line 145.

quemquam diruta quamquam, without a finite verbis
only found in the Silver Age. Alba Longa, with the exception
3ξᾷϊέ tierr2rples, was destroyed by Tullus Hostilius, as Livy nar·

61. ignem Troianum, which Aeneas hed brought from
Troy, together with the Penates. Conf. Verg. Aea. ii. 296,
“et manibus vittes Vestamque potentem, aeternumque adytis
effert penetralibus ignem.”

Vestam . . . minorem, as compared with the Roman
Veste. So we find in inscriptions, “virgo Vestalis arcis

Albanae.’'
Ι 62. parumper = παῦρον περ, a very little while.

64. exclusi . . . Patres. Among other characteristics of
despotic rulo, the emperors were very inaccessible to their sub-
liiidie 4l;l·iny eontrasts Domitian end Trajan in this respect,

65. ad Atriden, ironically, “the great king.”
Picens. The fisherman 3 Ancona was in Picenum.

66. privetis meiere focis, ‘⁴ too great for a private hearth.’'
Oonf. “Procula minor,'’ “omni crimine foedior.'’

genialis, sacred to your genius. Each person had a genius,
or protecting divinity, which was born with him (the root is
911), and eleo died with him.

67. stomachum laxare saginis. Mr. Macleene translates
this, “to distend your stomach with good things‚” referring
saginis to the fish. Iam afraid the reel meaning is less savoury,

· but more characteristic of Roman gluttony, “to relieve your

stomach of its last gorge.” saginis, ablative of privation.'
Emetics were frequent y taken for this purpose. It might be'
“to let out your stomach for a gorge.''

[133⁶de apertius? What could be more barefaced
a ery

et tamen 1111 surgebant cristae, “and yet his creet
roee.’‘ illi refers to Domitian, who is pleased and gretified even
with such transparent flattery. This is much better then to
ascribe quid apertius to the fishermau, in reference to ipse capi
coluit end then to suppose that the fish's creet rose, es if
indignently to deny the truth of his words.
