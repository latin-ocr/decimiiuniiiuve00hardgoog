and 51. Lastly, certain misstatements on matters of fact
are alleged: ep. Tentyra and Ombi described as neigh-
bours are really a hundred miles apart 3' Diana, contrary
to J uvenal’s statement in line 8, is worshipped in Egypt
under'the name of Bubastis (Ov. Met. ir. 691); Elpenor
in Homer (od. iv. 552) was not turned into a hog with
his companions, but broke his neck by falling down a

admitted cn all hands that both in this Satire and the

Juvenalian.

With regard to Sat. xvi. the scholiast says, “ista
exploditur a plerisque et dicitur non esse Iuvenalis,'’
evidence, however, which we may fairly say is cancelled
by the fact that both Priscian (viii. 6, 31) and Servius
(on Verg. Aen. i. 16 and ii. 102) quote the Satire as
J uvenal's. Among modern scholars Heinrich is perhaps
the representative of those who deny its genuineness, for

¹ ’ Ribbeck is disposed to ascribe this Satire to what he

calls Juvenal the satirist as opposed to Juvenal the

acter of the poem, and its comparative wealmess of style,
there is really no evidence against its authenticity. As
far as the contente go, and the references to military
affairs and institutions, there is nothing whatever incon-
sistent with its having been written in Hadrian's reign,

and although Gibhon (chap. v. note 64) says that the
style and circumstances of the Satire would induce him
to believe that it was composed under Severus or Cara
calla, he brings forward no reason to support this state-
ment, and in point of fact there is none. With regard
