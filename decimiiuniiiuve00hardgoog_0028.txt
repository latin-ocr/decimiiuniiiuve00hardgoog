xxiv INTRODUCTION

(3) wherel The fact ol the banishment seems to me to
be as well established as any other fact of Juvenal's
life. All the Lines attest it, and Sidonius Apollinaris

, (ens-484 Ab.) certainly alludes to Juvenal in the

lines (ta 267 foll.)—

Non qui tempore Caesaris secundi
Aeterno incoluit Tomos reatu
Non qui consimili deinde casu

Ad vulgi tenuem strepentis suram
Irati fuit histrionis exul,

while the fourth line seems to show that he did not
derivo the story from any of the Lines as we know them,
and if so, he is an independent authority. But by whom
was the punishment infliotedl Some say by Domitian,
but a number of obvious arguments may be urged against
this. (1) The only reason adduoed for connecting it
with Domitianis the story of the lines composod against

Paris. This I have disposed of above, and besides, this
would necessitate the date of the banishment being placed
not later than 33 ω. (2) Most of the Lines say that he
remained in exile till his death, and Sidonius Apollinaris
in comparing his fate to Ovid's (“ aeterno . . . reatu'’
and “consimili oasu'') seems to imply the something.
But to suppose that he remained in exile during Trajan's
and Hadrian's reigns, the period when he wrote his
Satires, is absurd (3) The Satires, and especially the
first Book, clearly indicato that J nvenal knew Rome well
during at any rate the last half of Domitian’s reign.
(4) We know from Martial, vii. 24 and 91, that Juvenal
was in Rome in 91 or 92 sn.,1 and from xii. 18 that he

¹Friedltnder shows that Book vii. of the Epignomo was pub-
lished at the end of 92 (Sittenqesela vol. iii. p. 432).
