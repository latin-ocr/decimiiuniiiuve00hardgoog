continued writing till about 130 an. when he was dis-

lived to be over eighty.

That the statement about these verses rests on an old
tradition is clear from the consensus of the Licea, but Ι
think it is almost equally clear that it rests upon a
mistaken inference from the lines in Sat vii There
Δ Juvenal, according to his custom, is alluding tc present
ahusen, though using the names of a pest time. But as
the lines were probably in some way connected with
Juvenal's banishment‚ special interest was from early
times attached to them, and an appearance of greater
reality given to them by the story that they were com-
posed during the lifetime of the Paris referred to‚1and
then afterwards inserted in Sat. vii„ a thing extremely
improbable in itself, especially as the fact that Paris was
killed in 83 an. would imply an interval of about forty
years between the original verses and their insertion
in Sat. vii.
