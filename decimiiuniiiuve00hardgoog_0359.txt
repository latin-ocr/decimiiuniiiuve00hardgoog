17. Fonteio consino natus. These words conclusively fix
the date cithia Satire. thre the name of ono consul is given
to fix a year it is always the name of the senior consul. Now
there was a Fonteius Capito consul in 59 mu, but hc was the
junior consul ; in 67 au. another Fonteius Capito (Tac. Hier. i.
7) was senior consul. This therefore must be the year intended
by Juvenal, and accordin ly the date of the Satire is 127 arn,
ie. the tenth year cf H rran’s reign. But tharsis a further
question as to the subject of “ haec stupet.” This l formerly
took with Friedl'tnder to refer to Juvenal himself. “A men
like me, born sixty years ago, wonders atthis exocssive anger.”
But attractiva as it is thus to get the exact date of Juvenal's
birth, I am now convinced by the arguments of L. Schwabe
(anteacta Murrum, xl. p. 25 seq.) that itis Calvinus who is
referred to, though in the third erson instead of the second,
