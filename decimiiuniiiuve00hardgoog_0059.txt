INTRODUC‘I'ION lv

to the question whether Sat. xvi. was left a fragment by
Juvenal, or whether the remainder has been lost, there
are two important pieces of evidence both tending in the
same direction—(l) line 60 ends a quaternion in P,
and there is no subscription “Explicit liber quintus '' as
there is at the end of all the other books, eo that the
presumption is that some leaves at the eud of the
archetype have been lost 3 (2) this is confirmed hythe
following calculation: the Scholia to lines 129-1580f
Sat. vii. in P. and the Codex scarponense 870 arc miss-
ing, from which it may be safely inferred that one page
of the archetype was missing, and that each page of the
archetype contained thirty lines. Nowif we reckon up
from Sat. vii. 159 to the end, countiug in the lines
occupied by the subscription at the end of each book and
the superscription at the head of each Satire, we find
again thet sac. xvi. 60 would comest the bottom of a
page The Satire was, therefore, no doubt finished by
Juvenal, but has been lost from the archetype from

Ι which all our existing MSS. are derived.
