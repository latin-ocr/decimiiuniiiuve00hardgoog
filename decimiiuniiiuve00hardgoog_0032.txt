xxviii INTRODUGTION

seventh were stationed in Mauretania during the first
two centuries, but the partly illegible number 00 the
inscriptionis certainly not one of these. The first cohort
is proved bya military diploma (0. I. L. vii. 1195) 10
have been in Britain in 124 sm, and also under
Antoninus Pius (ab, 400), being stationed at Uxellodunum

10 vcumberland. The second oohort was stationed 10
the second century at Magnae, one of the statione along
Hadrian's wall (ih. 760), and was still there at the date
referred to by tho N otitia, ie. about the end 01 the second
century. The fourth cohort is proved hyamilitary diploma
(ab. 1194) to have been in Britain in 103 0.0.; and as
Hubner points out, there is the greatest probability
that afl five cohorts came over 1ο Britain with the
leyio 9th Hispana, which was itself a Pannonian legion
previously to its removal to Britain by Claudius (Tac.
Aac. xiv. 32). Three (Ι. ΙΙ. IIII.) out 01 the five
at any rate were certainly there early in the second
century, and had probably been there for some time
previously, and the reading 00 the stone is almost
certainly I. or II. It is therefore in the highest degree
probable that the tradition that Juvenal was seut as
praefect 010 oohort 000100 Socios depende on historical
grounds, though not connected, as 10 the Life, with his
exile. But knowing that Juvenal served in this military
capacity, we are in a position to draw some further
inierences, The position 01 praefeci 01 00 auxiliary
cohort was a definite gradc in a definite military career,
and could be reached only iu oue of two ways. It
might be gained by enlisting as a common soldier, and
theu rising gradually to be arenturion, then a primipilus,
and then a praefert 01 0 eohort. It was, however,
