These are the main grounds, in addition to themora
impalpable arguments derived from the feebler style,
more frequent repetitione, more constantly occurring
redundancies and awkward digressione, which have sug-
gested to Ribbeck his characteristically German theory
as to the genuine and the spurious Juvenal. I will only
mention, without dwelling on, three lines 81 argument
against a view which never has aud probably never will

the first place, the faults 81 redundancy, repetition, and
rhetorical extravagance which Ribbeck points out in the
later Satires are also to be met with, though perhaps

admits, but meets the argument by asserting that the
passages in the earlier Satires where these features meet
us most strongly are also interpolatione by the later
declamator. Such arguments are always dangerous, and
